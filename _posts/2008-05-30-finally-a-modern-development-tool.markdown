Watch the following video and prepare to be amazed.

<a href="http://www.fiveruns.com/">FiveRuns</a> has made a seriously awesome and useful tools for Ruby on Rails developers.  Not only does it tell you load times for pages, but it breaks it down into view and model times.  If you can't figure out how to fix it, you can upload your profile to their site to share with co-workers or make it public to gather community help.

I personally don't pay much attention to the Ruby performance bashers, but with tools like these, I won't be surprised if RoR apps quickly develop a reputation for being lightning fast.  I would love for this to exist for <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, which is the platform I use most.  At Chesspark, we've mostly concentrated on optimization by <a href="http://metajack.im/2007/07/25/do-you-know-what-your-database-is-doing/">analyzing database queries</a> and <a href="http://metajack.im/2007/08/02/django-patches-for-efficient-database-access/">improving database use in the Django framework</a>.

I've always had a dream that someday I would spend a fair amount of time making better tools for developers.  While I haven't quite found the time to do that yet, I'm very happy to see others succeed in this area.
