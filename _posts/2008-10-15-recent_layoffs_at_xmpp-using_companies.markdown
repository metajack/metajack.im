Two companies which use XMPP have laid off workers in the last week or so.  First, [Seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com) [laid off a third of its staff](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/10/getting-the-unparty-started-seesmic-lays-off-13-of-staff/), and now, [Jive Software](http://www.jivesoftware.com) has [done the same](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/14/jive-software-lays-off-13-of-staff/).  Thankfully, [XSF](http://www.xmpp.org) members and Seesmic employees Mike Taylor and Nathan Fritz were not among the cuts.

## What Does It Mean?

In general, I think that everyone is thinking hard about how to tighten their belts and some companies are taking preemptive action.  No one knows how long this economic fiasco will last, but it seems wise to assume the worst and make some effort to ensure your the company can weather the storm.

For XMPP, I don't think it means much.  I continue to think that it's still a [good time to be an XMPP developer](http://metajack.im/2008/09/24/xmpp-hackers-in-demand/).  Even as companies are trying to cut back, XMPP is still becoming a critical technology, and smart companies will not be reluctant to hire key people who are familiar with the protocol.
