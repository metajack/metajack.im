I hope everyone is excited about the new year, and to celebrate, I've
got a present for everyone - Strophe.js 1.0 has finally been released!
You can find it on the [Strophe site](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe).

This code is the result of much labor and love over the last four
years, and I'd like to share the history of its origins.

Back in 2005, Chesspark was still just getting underway. We had been
busy working on the backend code as well as a desktop client for
Windows. Gmail had been release just a year earlier, and Google maps
was just six months old or so. People were just getting excited about
AJAX, but it was still early days.

I came home one day in September 2005 to find my wife enthusiastically
hacking on something. She showed me a very cool demo she wrote of a
chess board with draggable pieces written entirely in
JavaScript. Today, such a thing is commonplace, but back then, I was
absolutely floored. I had not being paying much attention to
JavaScript, and I had no idea that it was capable of such things.

I was extremely inspired by the demo, and I started to imagine a
web-based Chesspark client. I started reading anything I could get my
hands on related to AJAX or DHTML. At some point I stumbled across the
young [XMPP HTTP binding](http://xmpp.org/tech/bosh.shtml)
specification.

I hacked all weekend and turned my wife's chess board demo into a
working XMPP game prototype. These were the first lines of the
Strophe.js library. The prototype was so promising, we completely
pivoted Chesspark to be web focused and launched a web-based,
real-time, multi-player gaming service based on XMPP in October of
2006.

After the launch, I told several people about Strophe, and the code
was available if you knew were to look for it. It took me almost three
years before I had time to re-factor, modularize, and prepare the code
for a real release. In June of 2008, I [announced this Strophe.js
preview](https://metajack.im/2008/06/30/strophe-preview-xmpp-in-javascript/).

Since then, it has been a wild ride. Here I am over four years later,
and my little weekend prototype has grown into quite a library, if I
do say so myself. I hope you enjoy Strophe.js.

Thanks to all of you who helped me along the way, contributed code,
bugs, or advice, or used Strophe in your own projects. Special thanks
to my wife, Kim, who unknowingly started it all.

Also, don't forget that Strophe.js now also has a book,a [Professional
XMPP Programming](http://professionalxmpp.com)! There are two full
chapters available for free that should help you get started to making
your own real-time XMPP applications.
