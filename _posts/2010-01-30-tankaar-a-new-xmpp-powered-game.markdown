Rohit Pardasani [just
announced](http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/gaming/2010-January/000004.html)
a new XMPP-powered game called
[Tankaar](http://www.tankaar.com/). Tankaar is a peer-to-peer
artillery game similar to Worms or the old QBasic classic,
Gorillas. It has an integrated messaging client, and both the
messaging client and the game use XMPP for communication.

I've long been a huge fan of using XMPP in the gaming space, so it
pleases me greatly to see more people working in this area. The built
in social features of XMPP are a perfect fit for multi-player games.

Tankaar is written in Java and uses the
[Smack](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/) library. It is
designed to be platform independent, but it appears that only a
Windows version is currently available for download.

I'll be e-mailing Rohit to see if he's interested in participating in
the [XMPP case
studies](https://metajack.im/2010/01/05/xmpp-case-study-interview-cabulous/) interviews.
