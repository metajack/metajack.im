All the feedback about my [ideas for XMPP Open Day](http://metajack.im/2008/11/05/interest-in-xmpp-open-day/) was very positive, so I think we should make it happen.  I've created a [conference outline](http://wiki.jabber.org/web/XMPP_Open_Day) in the [wiki](http://wiki.jabber.org), but I need your help to nail down the details and generate more ideas.

Please feel free to edit the wiki page, comment here, or [e-mail me directly](mailto:jack@metajack.im) if you have any feedback or wish to participate as a presenter or moderator.
