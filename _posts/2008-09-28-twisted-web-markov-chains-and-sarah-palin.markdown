If you are wondering what Twisted Web, Markov chains, and Sarah Palin have in common then you probably missed my post about how [Sarah Palin talks like a short-circuiting robot](http://metajack.im/2008/09/26/sarah-palin-talks-like-a-short-circuiting-robot/).  I was able to build the entire site in less than 24 hours by making use of Twisted Web to rapidly develop a simple Web application.  I'm releasing the code publicly since it makes for simple example of how to use Twisted Web.

You can find the code [in my Launchpad branch](https://code.launchpad.net/~metajack/+junk/interview).
