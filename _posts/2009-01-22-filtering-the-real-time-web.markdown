With so much data pouring in every direction, the problem becomes how
to extract signal from noise, relevant content from the merely
interesting.  At the same time one wants to keep a high level view of
some large swath of the data.

We've been thinking about this a lot as we create our real time search
engine.  There are good ideas coming in from all directions.  There
are new UI metaphors like [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com), new
interaction metaphors like Identichat (there's no great URL for this
yet, but it's essentially an XMPP MUC interface to microblogging), and
Facebook, FriendFeed and others have shown us the power of the
social graph as a filter.

I pose this question to all of you: how will we filter the [real time
web](https://metajack.im/2008/09/11/real-time-is-completely-different/)?
