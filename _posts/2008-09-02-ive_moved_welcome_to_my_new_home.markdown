[Peter](http://stpeter.im) is not the only one with a spiffy new dot im domain. I'm moving the blog to my new domain, [metajack.im](http://metajack.im).

I've moved the blog from wordpress.com to a hosted Movable Type installation. The short story is that I was tired of not being able to attach source code snippets to posts among the other limitations.
