It's the last day of 2008, and I have been thinking about what I have
done this year.

* [Chesspark](http://www.chehsspark.com) added many new features,
  fixed many bugs, and tried several huge experiments.  We explored
  the [freemium
  model](https://metajack.im/2008/09/12/dont-be-afraid-of-change/) as
  opposed to straight subscriptions, we launched
  [WuChess](http://www.wuchess.com) as a branded site in cooperation
  with [RZA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RZA), and we've spun it off
  under new management as we pursue a new project.

* [Stanziq](http://www.stanziq.com) was
  [born](http://mashable.com/2008/12/01/stanziq/) from a combination
  of our vision of the new [real time
  Web](https://metajack.im/2008/09/11/real-time-is-completely-different/)
  and many ideas we had at Chesspark.  The world needs a real time
  search engine.

* My team and I created and then released the code for
  [Speeqe](http://www.speeqe.com), a Web 2.0 style group chat
  application based on XMPP.  It's time for
  [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc) to die.

* I [learned some new
  languages](https://metajack.im/2008/10/22/be-multi-lingual-and-learn-a-new-language/).
  I have spent quite a bit of time with
  [Erlang](http;//www.erlang.org) this year, and I'm looking forward
  to solving more problems with it in 2009.  I've also
  [hacked](http://github.com/metajack/jekyll/tree/master) some
  [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) for the first time.  I've been picking
  up a bit of [Emacs Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp)
  and learning about [Haskell](http://haskell.org).

* I experimented with both [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org) and
  [Git](http://git.or.cz) heavily to replace my use of
  [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org).  I ended up [picking
  Git](https://metajack.im/2008/12/08/codestanziqcom-switching-to-git/)
  and have been extremely happy.

* I renewed my commitment to XMPP by joining both the
  [XSF](http://www.xmpp.org) board of directors and council.

* I finally achieved a long time goal of blogging more, which I hope
  to continue.

* Most important (to me at least), I gained a new family member - [my
  son, Jasper](http://www.misterjasper.com).  He puts a smile on my
  face every day, and something about constraints he imposes has
  increased my productivity.

I'm sure there is stuff I have forgotten.  I find it remarkable
difficult to remember how much time has passed since various events.
The last four years with Chesspark seem like they all happened in the
last year.
