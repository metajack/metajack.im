The long-awaited 1.0 release of the Strophe.js library is almost
here. I have finished the documentation and packaging but still have a
few bugs left to squash.  The finally release should ship before the
release of [my book](http://professionalxmpp.com) on December 21.

Please download and test the following release candidate, and post
your feedback to the [Strophe
group](http://groups.google.com/group/strophe/) or the [bug
tracker](http://code.stanziq.com/strophe).

* [strophejs-1.0rc2.zip](https://metajack.im/tmp/strophejs-1.0rc2.zip)
* [strophejs-1.0rc2.tar.gz](https://metajack.im/tmp/strophejs-1.0rc2.tar.gz)

The raw and minified versions of the library are included along with
documentation in HTML format.

If you have a pet peeve or a bug that needs addressing, make sure it
is in the tracker or bring it up on the mailing list.

I hope this packaging format is easier for people to use than the raw
Git repository.  Please enjoy!
