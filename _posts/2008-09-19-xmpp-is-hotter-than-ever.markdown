[Cisco](http://www.cisco.com) just
[announced](http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2008/corp_091908.html) they
are acquiring [Jabber, Inc](http://www.jabber.com).  This is great
news for the XMPP community.  It shows that big business is excited
about real time communication and that they don't have time for walled
gardens.  This news is [getting](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/19/cisco-acquires-jabber-for-enterprise-im/) [discussed](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/9/cisco-buys-jabber-hopes-employees-will-like-using-corporate-im) [a](http://www.process-one.net/en/imtrends/article/xmpp_getting_high_profile_cisco_announces_definitive_agreement_to_acquire_j/) [lot](http://broaddev.com/2008/09/19/cisco-buys-jabber-what-does-it-mean-the-big-trend-is/), but
here are some things other people aren't talking about yet.

## Branding Confusion

First of all, Cisco is aquiring Jabber, Inc, also known as
jabber.com.  The naming is slightly unfortunate because many will
wonder what will happen to XMPP and Jabber after the acquisition.

The answer is nothing.  The [XSF](http://www.xmpp.org) is the
maintainer of the standards.  Jabber, Inc is just one of many
commerical vendors in the XMPP space, just like Microsoft is just one
of many HTTP server vendors.

## What About Our Patron Saint?

[Peter Saint-Andre](http://stpeter.im), a cornerstone of the XMPP
community, is able to work on XMPP full time thanks to the generosity
of Jabber, Inc.  This is just one of the many ways that Jabber, Inc
has given back to this community.

I talked to Peter about this, and he said Cisco is committed to XMPP
and by proxy, him.  I didn't expect this to change, but I'm glad to
know for sure.

## XMPP versus SIMPLE

I would think that Cisco would be all over SIMPLE due to their focus
on SIP.  Jabber XCP, the server software Jabber, Inc sells, does have
SIMPLE integration, but [Joe Hildebrand](http://arch.jabber.com/), CTO
of Jabber, Inc, told me that Cisco is focused on XMPP with this
acquisition.

This looks to be another [nail in the coffin](https://metajack.im/2008/09/13/xmpp-at-the-ietf---its-simpler/) for SIMPLE.

## Only The Beginning

This is only the beginning of the action.  At nearly a decade old,
XMPP is starting to mature, and big companies are lining up.

They aren't the only ones.  [Twitter](http://twitter.com),
[Yammer](http://www.yammer.com), and other startups are trying to take
XMPP services to the next level.  I think we'll see the real
innovation continue to originate within the community for some time.  The big
companies will be focused on the traditional IM applications for a
while.

It's already been an exciting and unforgettable year for XMPP, and
it's only going to keep getting better.
