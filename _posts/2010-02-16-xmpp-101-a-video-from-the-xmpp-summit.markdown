The [8th XMPP Summit](http://xmpp.org/summit/summit8.shtml) has come
and gone, and it was a blast. I tried to record all the excellent
talks from the [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) XMPP dev room, but I only
managed to record the very first one. Watch below as
[Remko](http://el-tramo.be) gives a good overview of all things XMPP.

If you'd like to learn more about XMPP from Remko, he and some others
[wrote a
book](http://www.amazon.com/XMPP-Definitive-Real-Time-Applications-Technologies/dp/059652126X/?tag=metajack-20)
as well.

I'll bring some better equipment to the next XMPP Summit so that more
of these videos can be published.
