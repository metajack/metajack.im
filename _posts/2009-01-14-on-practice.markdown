These are two big reasons that I blog.  In a distributed company like
Stanziq or a distributed open source project, communication skills are
of great importance.  Being able to communicate effectively means
being able to write well.

I am always striving to improve my skills through practice, whether it
is [learning a new
language](https://metajack.im/2008/10/22/be-multi-lingual-and-learn-a-new-language/)
or doing regular blogging.  I've found this practicing to be
immensely helpful in a wide range of situations.

It doesn't hurt that I really enjoy writing, whether it be code or prose.
