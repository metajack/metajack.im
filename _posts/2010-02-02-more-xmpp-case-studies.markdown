I found the [XMPP Case
Studies](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/XMPP_Case_Studies) page in the [XMPP
wiki](http://wiki.xmpp.org) the other day. If you are looking for more
XMPP case study reading while I work on the next [case study
interview](http://metajack.im/2010/01/05/xmpp-case-study-interview-cabulous/),
these may be of interest. I can't believe I have never run across this
page before; it makes me wonder what other hidden gems are to be found
in the wiki.

Many of them are published by server vendors. There are several about
the [Jabber XCP](http://www.jabber.com/CE/JabberXCP) server, which is
one that you don't read about too often since it is commercial. 

They cover a broad range of uses as well, from [energy
trading](http://www.jabber.com/media/Jabber_Inc_Net_Energy_Case_Study.pdf)
to [major league baseball](http://www.process-one.net/en/news/article/mlb_processone_xmpp_chat_system/).
