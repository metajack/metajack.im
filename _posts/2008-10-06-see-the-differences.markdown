Last week I updated the [XSF](http://www.xmpp.org) Subversion repository to generate pretty HTML commit emails.  Now everyone can subscribe to the [commit list](http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/xmpp-commits) and see the specifications change right before your eyes.  This is extremely helpful to me as a [XSF Council](http://xmpp.org/council/) member; now I can easily follow along with all the changes to the specifications without leaving my e-mail client.

For those of you who want to similarly empower your own commit e-mails, I've written up [instructions](http://metajack.im/2008/09/06/power-up-your-commit-e-mails/).

Also, if anyone knows to how to make the pretty versions show up in the [archives](http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/xmpp-commits/), please let me know.  They currently seem to be stripped.
