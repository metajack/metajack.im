It's a new year, and that means new travels and conferences.  Here's
where I'll be if you'd like to get together and talk shop.

* On **January 13th** I'll be in San Francisco at [SF
  Beta](http://sfbeta.com) to demo [StanzIQ](http://stanziq.com) and
  other cool XMPP based things.  The event is at 111 Minna from 5-9PM.
* From **February 6th to 9th** I will be at the [6th XMPP
  Summit](http://xmpp.org/summit/summit6.shtml) in Brussels, Belgium.
  Between teh Jingle hack-a-thon, the XMPP Devroom,
  [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2009/) itself, and the actual summit,
  it will be a great time.  I'm looking forward to meeting all the
  European members of our community that I know only through IM.
* In **March** I'll be at [SXSW](http://www.sxsw.com).  Unfortunately,
  my [XMPP talk
  proposals](https://metajack.im/2008/08/08/learn-about-xmpp-at-sxsw-2009/)
  were rejected this year, but I'm trying to put together a little
  SXSW XMPP meetup anyway.

I hope to see some of you in my travels, and if you know of a cool
conference I should be at this year, please let me know.  I'm always
on the lookout for new places to go.
